                        This site presents a snapshot of the current state of the "rules" by which
                        course credits may be transferred between and into the campuses of
                        the University of Hawai&#699;i.

                        The site was designed to answer two different sorts of questions.  First,
                        if you have already taken (or plan to take) a given course you may
                        wish to know how, if at all, credit for that course will transfer to
                        some campus within the University system.  You may have taken the course
                        at a UH campus, or at some other university or college outside the UH
                        system.  This site can answer this sort of question by providing a
                        <i>list</i> of courses which transfer between two schools.
                        </div>
                        <div class="panel-body">
                        Second, there may be some course within the UH system which you need
                        or wish to take, but you would like to know if there are other campuses
                        offering an equivalent course.  Perhaps you are a student at UH M&#257;noa
                        and are curious about the possibility of taking a given course at
                        a community college.  You can use this site to find all courses offered
                        within the UH system which will transfer credit as that particular
                        course.  When you use this site to answer this sort of question, you
                        may be said to be <i>exploring</i> your options with respect to some
                        course.

                        <div class="panel-body">
                        These two questions correspond to the two "modes" of using the site,
                        and to your choice of which of the two links to follow from the
                        <link href='home'>site home page.</link>  If you are looking for a
                        <i>list</i> of courses which transfer between any two schools, you
                        will choose the <link href='list'>list mode link.</link>  If you
                        have a particular course in mind, and are looking to <i>explore</i>
                        your options, you will choose the <link href='explore'>explore mode
                        link.</link>

                        This site works by connecting to the database of course transfer rules
                        used by UH administrators.  Under normal circumstances, any changes
                        made by administrators will be visible in this site within 24 hours.

                        No, not really.  While every effort has been taken to make the information
                        provided by this site reliable, you should not rely on this site alone
                        in planning your schedule.  Administrators may be contemplating changes
                        to transfer rules, and any such changes will not appear in this site
                        until fairly late in the process.  Also, it is an unfortunate fact that
                        the program underlying this site itself may make mistakes.  This
                        site is provided in an attempt to get current information to students,
                        but should <i><b>not</b></i> be used as a replacement for your
                        academic guidance counselor.  Use this site to help plan, but always
                        confirm those plans with a counselor.

                        In some cases a course at one school will correspond to a particular
                        course at another school.  However, in many cases there is no precise
                        corresponding course at the "accepting" school.  Even so, in such cases
                        the accepting school may agree to give general or elective credits
                        for the course.  In such a case, the corresponding course at the
                        accepting school will appear with an acronym or abbreviation such
                        as <b>ELEC</b>.

                        Unfortunately, the 10 campuses of the University of Hawai&#699;i system
                        do not share a common scheme for these acronyms.  In general, the
                        acronyms refer to a part of the general education requirements of
                        the accepting campus.  Some campuses have provided
                        <link href='glossary'>glossaries</link>
                        for their acronyms and abbreviations.  In other cases, you should contact
                        an advisor at the campus in question for an explanation of the terms.
